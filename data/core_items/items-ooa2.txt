This iron spike can be fitted into the barrel of a two-handed firearm that doesn't have the scatter property with an {@action Interact} action. The spike is attached to a 50-foot-long coil of rope held in a simple spool that can be attached to a weapon's barrel. The weight and awkward balance of the bolt and its spool reduce the range of the weapon by 10 feet when fired. A creature hit by a harpoon bolt takes normal damage from the shot and must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save. On a failure, the harpoon bolt becomes lodged in its body.

The creator of the original thunder helm tried and failed time and again to craft a reliable, helmet-mounted firearm that enabled hands-free gunplay, but even after resorting to magical enhancements, they were never quite able to realize their vision. The allure of the thunder helm continues to compel certain mindsets in the Mana Wastes, and these items continue to be crafted to this day.

This clear quartz stone appears to have been smashed and then repaired by pouring molten copper into the cracks and fitting the shards back together using the copper as a sort of mortar. When a non-magical item in your possession with a value of 90 gp or less and a Bulk of 1 Bulk or less would become {@condition broken}, this aeon stone automatically activates, preventing the item from breaking by restoring the item's current Hit Points to the item's maximum Hit Points. The stone then turns permanently into a dull gray aeon stone. The stone's resonant power allows you to cast 1st-level {@spell mending} as a divine innate spell once per day.
