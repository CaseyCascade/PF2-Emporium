Tiny black motes swirl around this crystalline vial. The vial can be thrown up to 20 feet, shattering and releasing the motes to absorb light within a 15-foot burst. Light sources within the motes' area of effect create a 5-foot radius of {@quickref dim light||3|dim light} instead of their normal light and light sources outside the motes do not illuminate the area within them. The darkness lasts for 1 minute, but will disperse immediately in a strong wind.

This catalyst is a bird's claw soaked in a mixture of blood and grave dirt. A {@spell shadow spy|DA} spell empowered by it creates an unusually long-lasting {@creature homunculus}. Instead of the spell expiring when you next make your daily preparations, you can renew it by expending a spell slot for {@spell shadow spy|DA} again, maintaining the same {@creature homunculus} so it can continue its observations. Steadfast sentinels are often used by powerful spellcasters of Geb to covertly monitor their rivals.
