An archaic wayfinder functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cantrip cast into it. To fill an archaic wayfinder, a spellcaster casts the chosen cantrip into the empty device, providing any necessary cost; the spell cannot be one that is normally cast as a free action or reaction. {@action Activate an Item||Activating} an archaic wayfinder is the same as the casting for the relevant spell. Once it has been activated, it becomes empty again. An archaic wayfinder can hold an aeon stone and activate its resonant power. An archaic wayfinder counts against the limit of one wayfinder with a slotted resonant aeon stone.

They dry up and die if removed from the water for more than 1 hour, but as long as they're allowed access to seawater, they can usually survive for up to 1 year by feeding on micronutrients.

These flippers attach to your feet like tight shoes—donning or removing them requires three {@action Interact} actions. While worn, you gain a +5-foot item bonus to the distance you move when rolling {@skill Athletics} to {@action Swim}, not when using a swim Speed, and you take a –10-foot item penalty to your Speed.
