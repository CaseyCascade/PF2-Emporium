An archaic wayfinder functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cantrip cast into it. To fill an archaic wayfinder, a spellcaster casts the chosen cantrip into the empty device, providing any necessary cost; the spell cannot be one that is normally cast as a free action or reaction. {@action Activate an Item||Activating} an archaic wayfinder is the same as the casting for the relevant spell. Once it has been activated, it becomes empty again. An archaic wayfinder can hold an aeon stone and activate its resonant power. An archaic wayfinder counts against the limit of one wayfinder with a slotted resonant aeon stone.
