This 12-foot sword was made by a cyclops in the ancient past. It might be the greatest dragon-killing weapon ever made, and {@creature Fafnheir|LOMM} justly fears it, which is why he keeps it hidden in his hoard. Runes of dragon slaying are written down its blade. Ridill is a {@runeItem greatsword||+3 weapon potency||major striking||bane|SoM|speed||+3 major striking dragon bane speed adamantine greatsword}. While wielding Ridill, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against {@trait fear}. This increases to +4 if the effect is from a dragon. If you have an ability that depends on Large weapons (such as barbarian giant instinct), it works with Ridill.

This coin-sized golden pin depicts a bundle of five trimmed tree branches. Once you've stolen the pin, accepted it from Krampus willingly, or carried it for at least 1 minute, its curse activates. After that happens, the pin fastens itself to your clothing, providing you an insistent empathic admonition not to be naughty and constantly informing Krampus of your location, as {@spell status}. The pin reappears and reattaches itself within moments if discarded or destroyed. The pin constantly monitors your actions, judging you against a good-aligned {@class champion}'s code of conduct, plus the following third tenet:

On Tekritanin holidays, children reenacted legendary battles of deities by playing with magical tops. Though the paint on this wooden top has long since faded, its magical runes once gleamed yellow-gold and fiery orange, evoking the color of the sky during a sandstorm. To set the top in motion, wind a string around its bottom and upward along its body, and then throw it while gripping the string.
