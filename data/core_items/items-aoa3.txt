This mid-sized, silver cauldron is a boon within areas where access to fresh food is limited, for it can be commanded to fill itself with hearty (and delicious) vegetable stew. It can also be put to a much greater use in the pursuit of crafting certain items.

A {@i dreamstone} can become cursed if left exposed to creatures that corrupt sleep, generate nightmares, or otherwise prey on sleeping or dreaming victims via supernatural methods. A cursed {@i dreamstone} seems to function as a normal {@i dreamstone} until the bearer falls asleep or is forced to attempt a saving throw against a {@trait sleep} effect. At this point, the person carrying the {@i cursed dreamstone} must attempt a DC 26 Will save to resist the curse's effects.

A {@i dreamstone} is a disc-shaped object carved with imagery or words sacred to {@deity Desna}—be it her religious symbol, a short prayer, or merely the shape of a single star. When you carry a {@i dreamstone}, you find it easier to fall asleep, and you gain improved effects from the resulting rest. You always fall asleep within 5 minutes of lying down with the intention of sleeping, and you require only 2 hours of sleep per day to gain the benefits of 8 hours of sleep, provided you have carried the {@i dreamstone} for at least 24 hours prior to resting. As long as you carry a {@i dreamstone}, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against {@trait sleep} effects.
