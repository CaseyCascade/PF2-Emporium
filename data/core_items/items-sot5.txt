The cover of this grimoire is bound in a strange crimson, pebbly leather that a DC 40 {@skill Occultism} check to {@action Recall Knowledge} identifies as the hide of a rare monster from the distant plane of Leng. The grimoire's spine is bound in copper and a spiral of shifting runes slowly swirls across its surface.

The blade of this +2 greater striking adamantine longsword seems to absorb light from the air around it, giving the impression the wielder is standing in the shadow of a much larger creature. While Spellcutter is a potent weapon for battling undead and constructs, an ancient restriction on the blade prevents it from harming living creatures; attacks against living beings deal no damage. This restriction doesn't apply to dhampirs or creatures with the negative healing ability who are otherwise living; the magic of the blade can't distinguish between such beings and undead.
