Complex traps that incorporate ooze monsters into their ingenious construction have long been a favorite of those who seek devious ways to protect their {@condition hidden} laboratories, and it is from this tradition that the clinging ooze snare takes its inspiration. With its ingenious mixture of rare reagents, dried protoplasm harvested from ooze creatures, and a little pinch of alchemy, this snare triggers into an ooze-like hazard that temporarily mimics the dangers presented by a creature like a sewer ooze or other carnivorous protoplasmic monster. When a creature triggers a clinging ooze snare, the snare creates a short lived protoplasmic mass that lashes out in all directions, dealing {@damage 2d6} bludgeoning damage and {@damage 2d6} acid damage. The triggering creature must attempt a DC 21 Relfex save.
