A conducting weapon can channel energy through it. The weapon gains the resonant weapon trait, except that when you {@action Conduct Energy|LOAG}, the weapon deals an additional {@dice 1d8} damage of the selected type instead of 1 additional damage per die; if the weapon already had the resonant weapon trait, it deals {@dice 1d8} damage plus 1 damage per die instead. On a critical hit, the weapon deals {@damage 1d8} {@condition persistent damage} of the same type.
