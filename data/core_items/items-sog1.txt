While {@deity Yaezhing|LOGM} is feared and seldom worshipped in the open, some regions of Tian Xia see him as a god of necessary evil and their only hope for justice. This garment is often worn by bounty hunters or priests of {@deity Yaezhing|LOGM}, yet non-worshippers of the god of harsh justice sometimes wear this item without fear of religious persecution. The red cape appears almost black while in the shadows, with a lighter red mandala pattern on it that resembles a shuriken.

{@creature shou matsuki|SoG1|Old Matsuki}'s private brew has quite the kick. In addition to making you tipsy, this medicinal wine works wonders in helping to recover from disease—including (ironically) drug addiction. Matsuki's medicinal wine functions as {@item alcohol|GMG}, except that its saving throw is a DC 18 Fortitude save. In addition, upon drinking a dose of Matsuki's medicinal wine, you gain a +2 item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against diseases and poisons for 24 hours. This applies to your daily save against a disease's progression; however, the bonus doesn't apply to any checks you attempt against Matsuki's medicinal wine itself.

This unpleasant-looking hood appears to be a completely smooth, round sack of skin that feels uncannily warm to the touch. When you wear this hood and invest it, it merges with your head and face, becoming imperceptible as a worn item except on close examination, which reveals a slight oily sheen to your facial features. You can cause minor shifts and changes to your features while wearing a noppera-bo hood; this counts as having a {@item disguise kit} to {@action Impersonate} any creature that is the same ancestry as you.
