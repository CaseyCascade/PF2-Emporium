Knights make use of this magically treated powder to help hide their camps while traveling through the Gravelands or other dangerous regions. When you toss the powder into a campfire or other sizable fire, the fire produces a thin mist that enshrouds everything in a 10-foot emanation from the fire. The mist creates protective illusions that remain for up to 12 hours and make it difficult to spot the area from afar. You can end the effect earlier by putting out the fire. Light and smoke produced in the area aren't visible from outside the area. The illusions don't prevent sound from traveling nor prevent the area or its inhabitants from being seen.

During their journeys across the Gravelands, the Knights of Lastwall found several smoky, gemstone-like objects that knights refer to as detector stones. Some of the knights' Magaambyan allies believe the stones are aeon stones corrupted by the same energies that corrupted the Gravelands, though they don't display the characteristic orbiting behavior of aeon stones when invested. Despite the controversy, many knights use the stones for their ability to detect the presence of undead.

Kalabrynne Iomedar commissioned the first of these shields, which have become some of the Shining Sentinels' most valued equipment, replicated among these knights. A shining shield is a seemingly simple wooden shield (Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12) with the Shining Oath engraved on the inside. While raised, a shining shield moves itself to provide cover for your allies. If you have this shield raised and would provide cover to an ally against a foe by standing between them, the cover you provide increases one step. Thus, if you were to grant lesser cover, you grant standard cover instead; if you were to grant standard cover, you instead grant greater cover.

A shield with the throwing shield attachment can't have any attached weapons, such as shield spikes or a shield boss, and the adjustments to make it more aerodynamic make it slightly less sturdy, reducing its Hardness by 1.
