A large crystal of {@item warpglass|aoe6} floats above the head of this silvery purple +3 anarchic greater striking club. If you successfully {@action Strike} a creature, the cane also affects the target with a {@ability warpwave|AOE6}. While you carry the cane, you hear a constant, distracting chorus of laughing, incoherent Protean whispers and sing-song voices in your mind. Blatant acts of self-indulgence or narcissism quell these whispers, from a few minutes up to a full day depending on the scope of the act, but they immediately return when you use the artifact's powers.

This shining prism is bound within a golden frame. The bright glow within the artifact is the gleaming essence of celestials bound within it in ancient times. Each activation consumes a bit of this celestial energy, projecting the screams of the celestials into your mind. While holding the Radiant Spark, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against divine spells and effects and you are aware of its powers. If you are good, while holding the Radiant Spark, you are {@condition sickened|CRB|sickened 3} and can't recover from this condition.

Raw warpglass is an opalescent glassy material with surprising strength. When worked, it changes its appearance—though not its properties—to appear as random striations of other metals and types of stone.
