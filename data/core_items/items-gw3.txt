Copper cables run from these thick leather gloves to nodes that attach to the wearer's temples, allowing a spellcaster to convert the magic they normally cast to pure psychic intention. When you {@action Cast a Spell} using the telekinetic converters, you substitute any verbal spellcasting components for mental components of simple thought, granting the {@trait concentrate} trait to the spell you're casting.

This orange liquid lets you visibly detect the psychic energies that enable telekinesis and telepathy. For the next minute, you can sense if a creature you can see is using a telepathic or telekinetic ability, such as the telepathy monster ability, spells like telekinetic projectile or telepathic bond, or similar abilities. You also can sense if an object or creature you can see is being manipulated or contacted by such an ability. Both the user and the target of the ability are outlined in faint shimmers of matching color.

A malformed, artificial brain pulses with alchemical life inside a nutrient-rich vat. When the vat-grown brain is activated, it attempts to counteract one condition of your choice that was gained from an ability with the {@trait mental} trait, which it does by drawing the negative mental impressions into itself. However, the artificial brain is not robust, and the strain of the transfer quickly destroys it.

While many of the magical wonders created by saumen kar have been destroyed, ice forges, while rare, still see use today among the few individuals who manage to discover and keep one of these portable treasures. When an ice forge isn't activated, it appears to be a small anvil carved from a lump of ice no larger than an apple. While in this state, the ice forge remains cold to the touch but doesn't melt in the presence of high temperatures. It can be used to chill a beverage in a small container, although those who venerate and respect these items' legacy would doubtless find this use to be insulting at best.

Adlet spiritual leaders create this thick purple gel so that the dead can temporarily assume their appearance in life during ancestral worship ceremonies. Spreading it over the bones of an undead creature or a lifeless corpse causes the gel to congeal, forming a cosmetic layer that covers or restores any missing or compromised flesh until the body mimics its appearance in life. The dead creature's flesh looks healthy and whole. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus on {@skill Deception} checks to look like a living creature. The gel does not restore life or Hit Points and the flesh quickly rots away 8 hours after application.

A mindsponge appears as a misshapen gray sponge that unsettlingly resembles a malformed human brain. Though pliable in all the same ways as a damp sponge, a mindsponge has no ability to absorb water and, in fact, doesn't seem terribly porous at all. Instead, a mindsponge is used to absorb thoughts and memories from living creatures.
