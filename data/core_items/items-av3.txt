This strangest and most powerful of the fulcrum lenses resembles a chip of smooth obsidian containing three dark glimmers of {@deity Nhimbaloth|LOGM}'s essence. Incorporeal creatures can touch and hold the Ebon Fulcrum Lens. While you have the Ebon Fulcrum Lens invested, and you're a corporeal creature, you become insubstantial, gain the {@trait incorporeal} trait, and are {@condition drained|CRB|drained 2}. Your {@condition drained} condition can't be reduced below 2 as long as you have the lens invested. You can activate the lens in the following ways. Both require expenditures of glimmers within the lens; once the lens is depleted of its three glimmers, it retains its ability to make corporeal creatures insubstantial but can't be used for its other abilities until its glimmers are restored (which generally requires a ritual or being steeped in an area of {@deity Nhimbaloth|LOGM}'s power).

This silver and copper framework is shaped to hold four focusing lenses, one behind the other, from smallest to largest. It has a socketed base to be mounted into a stand, such as that found in a lighthouse lantern. The Fulcrum Lattice was specifically designed to hold the four fulcrum lenses from smallest to largest (ebon, crimson, ochre, emerald), and it hums slightly while within 10 feet of any fulcrum lens. A fulcrum lens slotted into the Fulcrum Lattice has no Bulk; the lattice remains at 1 Bulk and can be carried easily. Inserting or removing a lens from the Fulcrum Lattice requires a single {@action Interact} action.
