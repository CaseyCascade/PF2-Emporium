Used to write secret messages, a single dose of forgetful ink is enough to pen a page of text, often with flourishes extending to the page's edges. Anyone handling the page is exposed to the poison. This includes casual reading, unless the reader specifically takes precautions not to physically touch it. Unlike other poisons, forgetful ink retains its potency for one year, regardless of the number of victims exposed.

Originally designed by a fanatical sect of Gozren priests, goz masks were designed to help navigate the area around the Eye of Abendego. The masks couldn't contend with the might of the storm, but they remain in use by people all around the Mwangi Expanse. These masks are typically made of wood and crafted to sport round, exaggerated features.

These minor magic items are painted to resemble your face, or some metaphorical depiction thereof, to encourage the ushers of death to take the mask in your place. If you begin your turn with a {@condition dying} value of 3 or greater, instead of making your recovery check, you lose the {@condition dying} condition but remain {@condition unconscious} at 0 Hit Points. The mask then cracks in half and is destroyed. The psychopomps won't be so easily fooled again—you are temporarily immune to the effects of any psychopomp mask for 1 year.
