This green tea is often steeped in a pot with a dried persimmon. Traditionally, all participants in a complex discussion start their conversation with a tea ceremony involving covenant tea, with each member of the group enjoying the covenant of the shared beverage. Some have been known to use trickery and sleight of hand to ensure only those whose goals align with the tea preparer are served covenant tea, while others in the group are served non-magical (but still delicious) green tea, thus subtly tipping the balance in discussion toward those the tea server favors. This practice has resulted in some regions referring to covenant tea as "trickery tea." Regardless of what you prefer to call the tea, when you drink it, you gain a +1 item bonus to {@skill Diplomacy} checks and to your Perception DC for 10 minutes.

This sweet and refreshing tea is made by adding a mixture of honey, lemon slices, and sliced ginger.

This tea is brewed with a mixture of matcha, turmeric, and 10 drops of morning dew, creating a fragrant but mildly bitter tea. The bitter aftertaste is said to be the most important element of longnight tea, for it's believed that this flavor lingers on the tongue and aids in keeping you awake and alert. The tea is favored by scholars and soldiers alike, although the value to which each attributes the ability to endure long nights without sleeping varies—and is often the subject of unusually impassioned debate. When you drink longnight tea, it grants you a +1 item bonus to saving throws against {@trait sleep} effects for 1 hour.

Resurrection tea was named for its repugnant taste, said to be "strong enough to kill the living," and its incredible medicinal properties "powerful enough to raise the dead." The primary ingredients in this medicinal tea are ginseng and jujubes, enhanced with additional herbs, shaved deer antlers, sugi tree bark, and a variety of mushrooms stewed for several hours in a large pot to form a brown, pulpy, and viscous liquid. The bitterness and earthy taste make the tea rather unappetizing. The tea restores {@dice 2d8+5} Hit Points, and you reduce the DC of recovery checks by 1 for 8 hours.
