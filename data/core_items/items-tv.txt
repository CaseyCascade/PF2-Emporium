Stone was one of the earliest materials used to create tools, and crafters can still fashion it into a variety of implements, weapons, and even armor. Simple stone objects are made from common materials such as flint or basalt, while exquisite stone objects might be made from crystal, obsidian, or semi-precious gems. Particularly notable stone armors or weapons might even be crafted entirely from a giant emerald, ruby, or sapphire, though they can still use the base statistics presented below. Stone can replace the striking surface of any melee weapon as long as it has no complex moving parts, and ammunition can be crafted with it. Stone can replace metal components in chain and composite armor; only plate armor that specifically describes itself as being made from stone can be crafted from this material.

A durable material when properly treated, bone can replace wood and metal when creating armor, shields, and weapons. The statistics for bone are applicable to a variety of other sturdy animal-based products, such as chitin, horn, ivory, coral, and shell, which can also be classified as bone for the purposes of determining item statistics. Bone elements from certain beasts, like the horn of a unicorn or the spikes of a manticore, may even yield magical properties when worked by a skilled crafter.

ENTRY
Tools that are severely misused or left in malevolent circumstances can develop malicious sapience, dedicated to critiquing those who use them. Such heckling tools are often born from implements useful to adventurers because such people are the likely to misuse tools or leave them in a corrupting situation. When you first set to using the tools, they fuse to you. Used for their intended purpose, the tools telepathically badger and disparage you, mocking your abilities and giving you ill-founded advice. You must succeed at a DC 19 Will save to realize this badgering comes from the tools and not your own negative thoughts. Instead of the tool's usual bonus, you take a –2 circumstance penalty to checks made using heckling tools. Once you realize the tools are cursed, you can suppress their {@trait negative} effects, gaining their typical bonus for 24 hours if you succeed at a DC 17 {@skill Deception} or {@skill Diplomacy} check to placate them, often by offering obsequious, public admiration.

However, it protects you by drawing on the health of your nearby allies. When you roll the flat check for the armor's fortification rune, it protects you normally when you roll a 20. When you roll a 17, 18, or 19, though, the GM determines damage for the critical hit normally, then distributes half to you and the other half evenly among allies within 30 feet of you. If no ally is within range to take the distributed damage, the fortification rune fails to function.

Rather than passing on when they feel their death approaching, a rare few elderly arboreals undergo a ritual of preservation. This rite fuses the arboreal's consciousness into a branch, allowing their spirit to live on within the object. The branch functions as a greater verdant staff, though the arboreal spirit allows only partners willing to safeguard nature to use the staff's spells. An arboreal who decides to become an arboreal staff is more connected to shorter-lived species than others of their kind. Most choose to endure to share their knowledge with future generations, but they take a long view in ways that can be frustrating to their wielders.

Rather than seeking out new experiences to stave off the Bleaching, gnome spellcasters with the right know-how can infuse a small fragment of their consciousness into a doll, then send the doll off with a crew of adventurers to experience new things. Such gnomes might have difficulties that keep them from exploring or might be preoccupied with other pursuits, but the doll acts as an intermediary, transmitting the benefits of new experiences to its creator via a potent, but passive, psychic link. A bleachguard doll has the alignment and demeanor of its creator, but new experiences can cause the two to diverge. The doll's creator is neither able to control it nor are they constantly aware of its activities. If the original creator perishes, the doll sometimes becomes inert (essentially {@condition dying} as well), sometimes remains an intelligent item, and sometimes becomes a normal soulbound doll (Bestiary 304), diminished in power but with some of the item's capabilities.

Fine lines of djezet sparkle in conduit shot. When you Activate it, you name up to four creatures, in addition to you, that the ammunition's magic works for. When a conduit shot hits a target, which can be a square, it remains intact. It moves with a creature it struck, unless the GM determines otherwise, until that creature regains any Hit Points. If it doesn't stick to the target, the active ammunition instead falls into the target's space, remaining active. If you or one of the four selected creatures include the ammunition in the area of a spell that is 3rd level or lower; has an area of a burst, cone, or line; and does not have a duration, the djezet in the ammunition flares in striations of red light, increasing the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that has a radius of at least 10 feet or to the length of a cone or line normally 15 feet long or smaller. For a larger cone or line, add 10 feet to the length. These increases are based on the spell's original area, ignoring any increases due to other effects, such as the Widen Spell feat. Increasing a spell's area destroys the ammunition, which otherwise remains active for 1 minute.

Fate shot is made of a nickelâ€‘steel alloy carved with the smiling face of a comedic player on one side, while the other side holds the frown of a tragic dramatist. When you hit a target with this ammunition, roll a DC {@flatDC 11} flat check. On a success, treat all the damage dice for your attack as though they rolled the average damage +1, rounded up (for example, a fate shot arrow fired from a shortbow would normally deal {@dice 1d6}, which has an average of 3.5, so you deal 5 damage). This doesn't affect additional damage dice that only happen on a critical hit, such as those added by the {@trait deadly} trait. On a failure, roll the damage, but your target takes half damage, and you take the remaining amount as mental damage.

The scene is realistic, but all observers can clearly tell it's an illusion. Observers can't interact with the scene directly nor can they taste or touch elements of it to get a sensation you didn't personally experience, but they can attempt skill checks to discern more about the scene without altering its contents. For example, no one could see something you didn't, such as the true form of a creature polymorphed into a squirrel, but an observer might be able to use {@skill Perception} and {@action Sense Motive} to discern the squirrel was acting unlike a squirrel should.

This substance is the result of a failed alchemical experiment to regrow a severed arm. An extra outsized, uncontrolled limb of the sort used for manipulation grows from the victim's body. The limb initially flails about, throwing the creature off-balance. Once it "matures," the limb pummels the victim instead. The limb can't deal its bludgeoning damage if the victim is unable to take actions. Upon recovery from the poison, the extra limb withers and falls off.

While the star gun served Kaldemash as a powerful weapon, its most notable achievement was the accidental killing of one of Kaldemash's greatest friends. This death is what caused the regent to recognize the true destructive power of the star guns and led to him developing the Star Code, a set of rules of engagement and proper use of firearms still in use in Arcadia today. Although Kaldemash never named the weapon himself, all legends that mention the weapon refer to it as Kaldemash's Lament.
