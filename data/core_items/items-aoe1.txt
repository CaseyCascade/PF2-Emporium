You can apply this pale eggshell powder to one outfit, one object of up to Medium size, or up to 10 smaller objects in the same space, such as jewelry, to make them appear gilded for 1 hour. If used as part of {@action Make an Impression||Making an Impression} on an audience swayed by expensive clothing, it makes most clothing or jewelry seem to be worth 10 times as much as they really are. Only someone who closely inspects an affected item notices it's not real gold. If you apply the salts to an object made of metal, the metal softens like gold, reducing its Hardness by 4 (to a minimum of Hardness 10) for 1 hour.

Though expensive, these single-use alchemical bombs are often used by police forces to disperse unruly crowds and quell riots without risking permanent physical injury to either officers or civilians. The bomb can be thrown up to 30 feet, causing it to explode, spraying the aerosolized pepper dust in a 15-foot-radius burst. All creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save to avoid inhaling the dust or getting it in their eyes. On a failed save, the creature is {@condition blinded} for 1 round and then {@condition dazzled} for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is {@condition blinded} for 1 round, {@condition sickened|CRB|sickened 1}, and {@condition dazzled} until it removes the {@condition sickened} condition.

Popular throughout the Darklands for its ability to transform normally dull scents and flavors into intense, euphoric experiences, grolna can also be a great aid to trackers who want to follow scent trails, turning ordinary humanoids into effective bloodhounds.

Hendrid Pratchett himself designed this custom skull-topped +1 striking exquisite sword cane and had it gilded in high-quality gold. Its first victim was the very smith whom Pratchett commissioned to craft the weapon, so the means of its construction are a secret known only to Pratchett. The magic of the Reaper's Lancet applies to both the blade and the sheath, making them each effectively a +1 striking weapon, but only if both are wielded by the same creature—if the two components are shared between creatures, only the blade retains the rune's magic.
