Each of the legendary {@i Orbs of Dragonkind} contains the essence and personality of a powerful dragon. The {@i Orb of Gold Dragonkind} was the most powerful of them all, until it was shattered by Mengkare's draconic breath. Reconstructed at great expense by enslaved spellcasters toiling under the Scarlet Triad's watch, the {@i Flawed Orb of Gold Dragonkind} is a shadow of its prior self, yet it remains a potent weapon against dragons of all types.
