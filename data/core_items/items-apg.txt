This bizarre staff is made from oak, capped with a cluster of eye-shaped gemstones that seem to move and undulate at the corner of your vision. While wielding the staff, you can peer through the eyes, using your normal visual senses (including any benefits of spells affecting your vision, like see invisibility). You can maneuver the staff to see things around corners, at higher elevations, or in places where the staff can fit but your head can't. This doesn't provide sufficient line of effect to target creatures around corners.
