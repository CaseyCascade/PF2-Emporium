Rotating gears cover the outside of this imposing helmet. In order to function, the device must be wound for 10 minutes once every 24 hours. The clockwork helm has a calming and focusing effect on the mind.

This +2 resilient full plate, crafted from grim plates of iron, covers the entire body except for small holes for the eyes and mouth. While wearing the armor, you gain the benefits of a {@spell nondetection} spell. Additionally, creatures attempting to {@action Recall Knowledge} about a subject involving you must succeed at a DC 30 Will save. On a success, they can attempt the check normally. On a failure, they can still attempt the check, but even if they successfully {@action Recall Knowledge}, they don't remember you (although they might remember other details about the event). Creatures that fail their save can make another attempt to {@action Recall Knowledge} about you, but they must wait 24 hours to do so.

Shaped like a blade made from spinning gears, this {@item +2 weapon potency||+2} {@item greater striking} weapon can catch enemy weapons and grind up foes. In order to function, the gearblade must be wound for 10 minutes once every 24 hours. During this process, you can reconfigure the weapon to transform into a {@item bastard sword}, {@item greatsword}, {@item longsword}, or {@item shortsword}. It then gains all the features of the chosen weapon except that its Bulk is always 2 and it gains the {@trait disarm} weapon trait and the {@trait versatile B} weapon trait (which replaces any other {@trait versatile} trait the weapon might have). If you don't wind the gearblade, it becomes inert and has the statistics of a {@item greatclub}.
