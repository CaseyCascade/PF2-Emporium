This sweet-scented poison triggers vivid hallucinations in those who succumb to it, causing most to believe swarms of ravenous biting insects are feeding on them. So vivid are these hallucinations that the victims damage themselves by scratching and clawing at the imaginary swarm. At the GM's discretion, a creature incapable of clawing at itself might instead slam against solid objects, in which case the poison inflicts bludgeoning damage.

The frayed threads from the rips and tears in Hao Jin's Tapestry still contain traces of the Ruby Phoenix's magic. Hao Jin has collected most of these loose strings, but others occasionally find these potent silk strands in unexpected places. A ruby string can fulfill the cost requirement for an 8th-level create demiplane ritual (Advanced Player's Guide 241). When used in this way, the ruby string negates the need for secondary casters, and you get a success for all secondary checks. Alternatively, you can activate it to create a smaller demiplane without requiring the ritual.

Created by Black Sovereign Kevoth-Kul, this unique alloy of {@item cold iron (generic)||cold iron} and the skymetal {@item noqual (generic)|lotgb|noqual} can provide protection from magical assault. The process of cold-forging the two materials together is quite complicated and precise. Characters in search of sovereign steel weapons and armor will almost assuredly have to travel to Starfall to procure gear made from this rare alloy. While some believe it possible to craft shields of sovereign steel as well, in one of his fits, Kevoth-Kul yelled that he had no use for them and banned anyone from making such a thing. So far, his smiths have been too afraid to confirm whether or not it was a joke. All sovereign steel items (including weapon and armor below) have a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against magic that the item makes, and grant their bonus to saves the owner makes specifically to protect the item from magic (such as against the {@spell rusting grasp|APG} spell).
