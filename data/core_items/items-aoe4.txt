This heavier-than-air mist emits a soft glow. While this poison lasts, it causes its victims to shine from within with agonizing, brilliant radiance. This effect has the {@trait light} trait (although the poison itself doesn't, so only the {@trait light} effect can be counteracted by {@trait darkness} effects). The {@condition sickened} condition from daylight vapor can't be removed while the poison lasts, and when the victim enters an area of magical darkness, the poison attempts to counteract the darkness with a counteract modifier of +21. If the poison fails, it can't attempt to counteract the same darkness again.

ENTRY
Belladonna cultivated in planes hazardous to living visitors, such as the Shadow Plane or the Boneyard, grow with a strange, skeletal look to their branches. The leaves and berries of these extraplanar plants are partly incorporeal and significantly more toxic than belladonna grown on the Material Plane. When imbued with spirit-twisting magic, spectral nightshade quickly drains away the victim's vitality and makes colors painfully bright and bewildering. Spectral nightshade doesn't affect creatures that have no spirit; if a possessing spirit inhabits a body that takes poison damage from spectral nightshade, the possessor takes an equal amount of force damage, even if the possessor can't be affected directly by poisons.
