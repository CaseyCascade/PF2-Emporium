The Cube of Nex acts as a {@item Lesser Cube of Nex|LOIL} except it suppresses all magic within 5 feet of it with the effects of a 10th-level antimagic field spell, instead of just one school.

A Lesser Cube of Nex acts as a cube of force, but the effect lasts until you press the sixth face to {@action Dismiss} it, and the activation can be used once per hour. You must first {@action Dismiss} any previous activation before you use it again. Additionally, each Lesser Cube of Nex is attuned to a single school of magic. Within 5 feet of the Lesser Cube, all magic from that school is suppressed or impossible to cast, with the effects of a 10th-level {@spell antimagic field} spell. While there are eight Lesser Cubes of Nex, each of the artifacts is unique, as there's only one Lesser Cube of Nex for each school of magic.

If a target fails its saving throw against your seal fate (Advanced Player's Guide 224) spell after you've added this catalyst, it takes {@damage 1d6} {@condition persistent damage} of the type chosen for the spell ({@dice 2d6} if it critically fails).

This still-bloody rib was taken from a priest of {@deity Urgathoa} at the moment they passed into undeath and has a constant stench of decay. The first time any creature critically fails its saving throw against a {@spell mask of terror} spell cast using this catalyst, it also takes {@damage 6d10} mental damage, with a basic Fortitude save against the spell's DC, as it lives through the memory of having its rib torn from its body. Once any creature takes this damage, the defiled costa's effect ends, and no other creatures take the damage, even if they critically fail.

This simple charm is made from compacted grave dirt infused with bone dust. A {@spell harm} spell that's empowered by this catalyst can reach faraway targets. If the {@spell harm} spell is cast with 1 action, its range is 30 feet; if it's cast with 2 actions, its range is 60 feet. This has no effect on the three-action area version of harm, though in most cases, you don't have enough actions to Activate the token and cast a three-action harm anyway.

This fan of vulture feathers scatters on an unnatural gust of wind. If this catalyst is used to cast a {@spell ray of enfeeblement} spell that has been heightened to at least 5th level, instead of targeting a single creature, you cast the spell in a 30-foot-area cone. You don't make a spell attack roll, instead affecting all creatures within the area with the effect the spell would normally have on a hit. This means creatures within the area must attempt a Fortitude save to determine whether they're {@condition enfeebled}.

A spirited debate persists among scholars on whether the eponymous tyrant of this grimoire actually refers to Tar-Baphon, the necromancer Geb, or even the goddess {@deity Urgathoa} herself. This grimoire appears at first to be a series of writs that makes arrogant demands of the reader, those around them, and the universe. Anyone who gives these writings more than a cursory look realizes the writs hold spells much like any other grimoire, with the {@spell animate dead|APG} spell being particularly prominent. Tyrant's writs grants you the ability to demand more from the undead you animate.
