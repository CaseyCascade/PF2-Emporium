ENTRY
Typically used to fake one's death, this poison swiftly causes the imbiber to lose consciousness and suppresses vital signs. A creature examining the {@condition unconscious} target must succeed at a {@skill Medicine} check against the imbiber's {@skill Deception} DC + 4 to determine that the target is alive, and a critical success allows the examiner to determine that a toxin is causing the effect. The false death toxin has an extremely bitter taste ({@skill Perception} DC 10 to detect), making it difficult to trick a creature into consuming the poison against its wishes.
