An exploration lens is a magical glass lens designed for a bull's-eye lantern. When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern. You can find more information about exploration activities related to these lenses on page 496 of the Core Rulebook. Alternatively, an exploration lens can be installed in a wayfinder like an aeon stone. In this case, light (such as that from a lantern, torch, or {@spell light} spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the wayfinder in your hand for it to function.

This mask is made from the gills of the red-rib salamander, an amphibious creature unique to Terwa Lake. Once activated, the mask intensifies the odors of gaseous toxins, allowing you to automatically detect toxic fumes within 30 feet and their approximate source (making the source {@condition undetected} instead of {@condition unnoticed}). You can't wear other masks while you're wearing a red-rib gill mask.
