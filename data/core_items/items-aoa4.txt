This amulet is made from the scales of five ancient dragons. You gain resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and poison. If you take damage of one of these types from a dragon's Breath Weapon, the amulet begins to glow brightly; for the next 10 minutes, your resistance against that type of damage increases to 20. If you are subjected to a dragon's frightful presence, you can roll your saving throw twice and use the higher result to determine the aura's effects. This is a {@trait fortune} effect.

This magical chisel evokes the holy symbol of the elven goddess of art and architecture, {@deity Findeladlara|LOGM}. The {@i Guiding Chisel}'s original function was as a portal key to Duskgate, but as {@deity Alseta|LOGM}'s Ring faded from the collective memories of the elves, the chisel became known and used exclusively for its other abilities. Eventually, elven emissaries gave it to the dwarves of Saggorak as a gesture of friendship.

A {@i kin-warding} clan dagger can deflect attacks aimed at your allies. When you use the weapon's {@trait parry} trait, you can point the clan dagger at an adjacent ally instead of defending yourself, creating a shield of runes around them. The runic barrier grants your ally the weapon's circumstance bonus to AC, but you do not gain the bonus yourself.
