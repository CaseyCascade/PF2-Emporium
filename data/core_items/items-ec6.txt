This strand of hair shimmers like the strands of fate. When you activate the string, it resonates with a single, perfect note. The triggering saving throw becomes a failure or the triggering attack roll becomes a regular hit, not critical one. If the source of the attack or effect is an evil creature, that creature must succeed at a DC 41 Will saving throw or be {@condition enfeebled|CRB|enfeebled 2} and {@condition stupefied|CRB|stupefied 2} until the end of its next turn.

Piereta was a Knight of Ozem during the Shining Crusade, sworn to the service of Aroden's herald, {@deity Arazni|LOGM}. After {@deity Arazni|LOGM} perished at the hands of the Whispering Tyrant, Piereta became the first paladin to swear her service to the newly ascended goddess, {@deity Iomedae}. When she fell in battle, a fragment of her spirit clung to the sword through which she had wielded her faith in countless battles, granting the weapon a sentience of its own. The sword named herself after her fallen bearer and has been a faithful companion to many Iomedaean warriors since.
