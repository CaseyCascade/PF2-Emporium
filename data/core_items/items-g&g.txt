Ablative shield plating is an amalgam device that provides a layer of additional protection for a shield. Ablative shield plating is cobbled together from parts of other shields, wires, scraps, and bits of detritus, adding mass to a shield. The process of attaching ablative shield plating takes 10 minutes, and you can't attach ablative shield plating to a shield that has any other attached item, such as a shield boss or shield spikes.

Air cartridge firing mechanisms use a container of compressed air affixed to a sealed system that releases the air in a small burst to propel ammunition, and they're the default used in Arcadian air repeaters. Any firearm can be modified to replace its normal firing mechanism with an air cartridge firing system, allowing the weapon to be fired underwater or in other conditions that would normally prevent the ignition of black powder. The air cartridges lack much of the propulsive power of black powder, however, imposing a –10-foot penalty to the attached firearm's range increment. Weapons with the kickback trait don't gain that trait's benefits when using an air cartridge firing system.

Named for Ancil Alkenstar, this bronze cannon is one of the largest pieces of mobile artillery ever deployed, though its immense weight limits just how mobile it actually is. The barrel of an Alkenstar cannon is nearly 3 feet in diameter, making it impractical to manufacture and handle cannonballs of sufficient size. Instead, Alkenstar cannons spray buckshot in a similar way to blunderbusses, firing large barrels that break apart mid-flight and release a rain of scattershot over a massive area. The slow movement and short range make this siege weapon fit fewer situations than most, but when used effectively, such as to stop a charge of Mana Waste mutants against the walls of Alkenstar, the results are devastating.

A drake rifle is a firearm made from the saliva glands of a drake. The firearm launches small bursts of empowered spittle instead of typical rounds of ammunition. A drake rifle is a {@item +1 weapon potency||+1} weapon. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals {@damage 1d10} damage with a range increment of 150 feet and reload 1. It deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage, depending on the drake from which it was made. On a critical hit, the spittle clings to the target and they take {@condition persistent damage} of the same type as the weapon equal to {@damage 1d4} + the number of weapon damage dice. A drake rifle does not add critical specialization effects.

Patriotic to the extreme, this {@runeItem flintlock musket|G&G|+2 weapon potency||flaming||greater striking|} was among the first firearms forged in the Gunworks and was wielded by Ancil Alkenstar, founder of the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar. In Alkenstar's hands, the musket was used to defend the burgeoning Grand Duchy from outside threats, including mutants of the Mana Wastes, Nexian constructs, and undead from Geb. After Ancil's death, the weapon was passed down, per his own decree, not to his heirs but to the greatest defender of Alkenstar, as determined by the weapon's previous owner. Over time, the devotion and heroism of each successive wielder left a psychic imprint on the weapon, until it developed an intellect and drive of its own.

Named for Brondar Steelheart, one of the most important historical dwarven pioneers in the use of black powder, this remarkable piece of new Dongun artillery uses metallurgy and alchemy to negate nearly all of the immense amount of recoil a shot from a siege weapon usually produces. The barrel of the Steelheart 21 is suspended in a mix of alchemical fluids that first compress to dampen the recoil when fired, then expand to push the barrel back into place afterwards. The result reduces the amount of time needed to reset the aim of the siege weapon. The crew member who launches the Steelheart 21 can use the Quick Aim reaction (below), allowing them to adjust the weapon's aim on the fly as they fire to adapt to a faulty initial target, changing battlefield conditions, the use of illusions by the enemy, or any of a variety of other factors that lead to the need to alter the siege weapon's course.

This +2 striking fearsome dueling pistol (Advanced Player's Guide 260) is made from fine tigerwood, with the head of a tiger as the muzzle. Beneath the tiger head is a claw shaped bayonet. One of a set of four guns crafted as a gift to a Zenj family for delivery of rare healing and diseaseabating herbs during an outbreak of a deadly disease in the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, these firearms are now passed down to those who have done brave acts in service to the Zenj people. The flintlock sparks thrown by this weapon take the shape of pouncing tigers and the firearm's report sounds like a tiger's growl. Clever wielders use the firearm's report to panic their prey into mistakes and then pounce for the kill.

This wheelchair is tailored for adventures and travels. The design is sleek and fashionable to provide excellent comfort and support. A traveler's chair has small mechanisms, either made from interlocking wood pieces, clockwork, or other devices, that allow the chair to traverse up or down stairs without any additional difficulty (moving up stairs is still {@quickref difficult terrain||3|terrain}, just like for other characters), and move through other such environments that adventurers and travelers encounter without any additional difficulty, such as ladders and uneven ground.

Tripods are designed for use with kickback weapons, as a way for gunslingers with lower strength to accurately use these more powerful weapons by sacrificing mobility instead. They can be set up and attached to a firearm with a single {@action Interact} action using one hand, setting the tripod in your square. While this sturdy piece of engineering is in use, you don't take the –2 penalty for firing a {@trait kickback} weapon, even if your Strength isn't high enough to avoid the penalty. However, you must retrieve the tripod with a single {@action Interact} action before you can move the firearm to a different position. Normally, when you're {@condition hidden} or {@condition undetected}, you become {@condition observed} if you do anything except {@action Hide}, {@action Sneak}, or {@action Step}. However, deploying or retrieving a tripod with an {@action Interact} action doesn't automatically make you {@condition observed}, so long as you don't set up or remove the tripod when it's in a spot where creatures can see the tripod itself.

This ammunition was developed in Dongun Hold to minimize casualties to {@condition friendly} fire, and is always marked by a burnished copper head or tip so it can be easily identified. Before you can fire a trustworthy round, you must call out a target. You don't need to specify a name; the target could be "The angry tiger attacking our group on the left." The round will only hit the specified target and will turn to gossamer dust midair if it misses the intended target or comes into contact with anything else; this also prevents abilities that redirect attacks. The round doesn't have any capabilities beyond your own to determine whether someone is who you think they are, so you can't use it to determine a disguised creature's identity.

This device replaces the attached firearm's normal firing mechanism (normally, most of the guns in this chapter use a flintlock or matchlock firing mechanism). When the firearm's wielder fires the weapon, a small rune etched on a piece of stone affixed inside the mechanism releases a magical spark that's propelled through the firing mechanism and into the firearm, launching its bullet. An underwater firing mechanism allows the attached firearm to be fired underwater or in other conditions that would normally prevent the ignition of black powder. Attaching an underwater firing mechanism to a firearm takes 1 hour, though this time can overlap with the standard time required to maintain and clean your firearm to prevent misfires.

This primitive device can be cobbled together from springs, wheels, and scrap and is commonly used to carry rocks or other dead weight forward to trigger traps. It can be loaded with up to 4 Bulk of items. Most creatures aren't small enough to fit on the cart, and even for Tiny creatures, it makes for a choppy ride; while riding the cart, a creature gains two actions at the start of each of its turns, instead of three. Once activated, the cart moves forward at a speed of 30 feet per round on your turn for up to 1 minute. If it strikes an obstruction, it attempts to continue its movement, pushing with an {@skill Athletics} bonus of +5, once per round. The wind-up cart has AC 15, Hardness 2, 24 Hit Points, and a Break Threshold of 12. After its 1-minute duration completes, the cart collapses back into scrap.
